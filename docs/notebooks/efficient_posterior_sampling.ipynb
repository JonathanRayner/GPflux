    "# Efficient Posterior Gaussian Process Sampling\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this notebook is to demonstrate how to efficiently draw samples from a posterior Gaussian process (GP) following Figure 3 from Wilson et al. \"Efficiently sampling functions from Gaussian process posteriors\" (ICML, 2020). The problem of sampling naively from any GP is that it requires to generate samples from a multivariate Gaussian as a consequence of evaluating the GP at a certain number $N^\\star$ of evaluation points. However, sampling from a multivariate Gaussian with dimension $N^\\star$ scales cubically with $N^\\star$ because it requires a Cholesky decomposition of the $N^\\star \\times N^\\star$ covariance matrix. More formally, drawing a sample $\\textbf{f}$ from a multivariate Gaussian $\\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma})$ with mean $\\boldsymbol{\\mu}$ and covariance $\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}$ can be accomplished via\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\textbf{f} = \\boldsymbol{\\mu} + \\text{chol} (\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma}) \\textbf{z}  \\; \\text{ where }  \\; \\textbf{z} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\textbf{0}, \\textbf{I}),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\text{chol}$ referring to Cholesky decomposition. \n",
    "\n",
    "Under certain assumptions, inference problems can have a posterior GP, for example, in a simple regression problem with real-valued labels, i.i.d. training data $\\{(X_n, y_n)\\}_{n=1,...,N}$ and a univariate Gaussian observation model of the form $p(y_n| f(X_n), \\sigma_\\epsilon^2)$ (with mean $f(X_n)$ and variance $\\sigma_\\epsilon^2$, and where $f(X_n)$ refers to evaluating a random GP function $f(\\cdot)$ at $X_n$). Drawing a sample $\\textbf{f}^\\star$ from the posterior GP at $N^\\star$ evaluation points $\\{X^\\star_{n^\\star}\\}_{n^\\star=1,...,N^\\star}$ can then be accomplished through\n",
    "\n",

The terms $\\textbf{K}_{\\textbf{f} \\textbf{f}}$, $\\textbf{K}_{\\textbf{f}^\\star \\textbf{f}}$ and $\\textbf{K}_{\\textbf{f} \\textbf{f}^\\star}$ refer to (cross-)covariance matrices when evaluating the kernel $k(\\cdot, \\cdot^\\prime)$ at training points $\\{X_n\\}_{n=1,...,N}$ and test points $\\{X^\\star_{n^\\star}\\}_{n^\\star=1,...,N^\\star}$, and $\\textbf{y}$ denotes all training targets $\\{y_n\\}_{n=1,...,N}$ in vectorized form.\n",

    "     \n",
    "with $\\textbf{f}_{\\text{prior}}$ and $\\textbf{f}^\\star_{\\text{prior}}$ referring to random samples obtained when jointly evaluating the prior GP at both training points $\\{X_n\\}_{n=1,...,N}$ and evaluation points $\\{X^\\star_{n^\\star}\\}_{n^\\star=1,...,N^\\star}$. Note that this way of obtaining samples from the posterior GP is not alleviating the computational complexity problem in any way since sampling $\\textbf{f}_{\\text{prior}}$ and $\\textbf{f}^\\star_{\\text{prior}}$ from the prior GP has cubic complexity $\\mathcal{O}((N + N^\\star)^3)$.\n",

    "However, one can approximate a kernel $k(\\cdot,\\cdot^\\prime)$ with a finite number of real-valued feature functions $\\phi_d(\\cdot)$ indexed with $d=1,...,D$ (e.g. through Mercer's or Bochner's theorem) as:\n",

    "\n",
    "with $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}$ referring to the $N \\times D$ feature matrix evaluated at the training points $\\{X_n\\}_{n=1,...,N}$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^\\star$ to the $N^\\star \\times D$ feature matrix evaluated at the test points $\\{X^\\star_{n^\\star}\\}_{n^\\star=1,...,N^\\star}$. The quantities $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^\\star \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^\\intercal$ and $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi} \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^\\intercal$ are weight space approximations of the exact kernel matrices $\\textbf{K}_{\\textbf{f}^\\star \\textbf{f}}$ and $\\textbf{K}_{\\textbf{f} \\textbf{f}}$ respectively. The weight space Matheron representation enables one to sample more efficiently with a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(D)$ that scales only linearly with the number of feature functions $D$ (because the standard normal weight prior's diagonal covariance matrix can be linearly Cholesky decomposed). The problem is that many feature functions are required in order to approximate the exact posterior reasonably well in areas most relevant for extrapolation (i.e. close but not within the training data), as shown by Wilson et al. and as reproduced in another `gpflux` notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to provide a remedy, Wilson et al. propose a \"hybrid\" sampling scheme that enables to approximate samples from a GP posterior in a computationally efficient fashion but with better accuracy compared to the vanilla weight space Matheron rule:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textbf{f}^\\star \\approx \\boldsymbol{\\Phi}^\\star \\textbf{w} + \\textbf{K}_{\\textbf{f}^\\star \\textbf{f}} (\\textbf{K}_{\\textbf{f} \\textbf{f}} + \\sigma_\\epsilon^2 \\textbf{I})^{-1}(\\textbf{y} - \\boldsymbol{\\Phi} \\textbf{w}) \\; \\text{ where } \\; \\textbf{w} \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\textbf{0}, \\textbf{I}),$$\n",
    "\n",
    "that combines both feature approximations and exact kernel evaluations from the Matheron function and weight space approximation formulas above.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subsequent experiments demonstrate the qualitative efficiency of the hybrid rule when compared to the vanilla Matheron weight space approximation, in terms of the Wasserstein distance to the exact posterior GP. The required classes in `gpflux` in order to conduct these experiments are `RandomFourierFeatures` to approximate a stationary kernel with finitely many random Fourier features $\\phi_d(\\cdot)$ according to Bochner's theorem and following Rahimi and Recht \"Random features for large-scale kernel machines\" (NeurIPS, 2007), as well as `KernelWithMercerDecomposition` that approximates a kernel with a given set of feature functions."

Each plot has two different sets of curves: orange curves refer to experiments with a weight space approximated posterior GP and blue curves to exeriments with a hybrid-rule approximated posterior GP. Each set of curves contains different repetitions for a different number of random Fourier feature functions used for approximating the exact kernel (many features are indicated with dark colours and fewer features with lighter colours).\n",

As expected, more features lead to better results resulting in a lower value for the log Wasserstein distance."
