# Variational Inducing Spherical Harmonics

The repo contains the code for the VISH algorithm. 

## Intro

Variational Sparse Gaussian processes that use Spherical Harmonics as inducing basis functions.
The Spherical Harmonics form an orthonormal basis on the hypersphere, which leads to a diagonal Kuu matrix.
